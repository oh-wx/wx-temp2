THURSDAY...

* TEMPERATURE...Between 96 and 101 degrees.

* HEAT INDEX...Between 105 and 110 degrees.

* IMPACTS...Heat exhaustion or heat stroke may set in if

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

A Heat Advisory means that afternoon heat index values are
expected to meet or exceed 105 degrees for at least two
consecutive days.

Be sure to check on persons with health problems and the elderly,
as they are the most susceptible to heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Never leave young children or pets in an enclosed
vehicle, even for a short time, as temperatures can quickly rise
to life threatening levels.

Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside.  When
possible, reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or
evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat
stroke. Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing when
possible and drink plenty of water.

To reduce risk during outdoor work the occupational safety and
health administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke
is an emergency - call 911.
