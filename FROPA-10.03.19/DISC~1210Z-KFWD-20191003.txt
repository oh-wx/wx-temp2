.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

A cold front pushing through southern Oklahoma will be the primary
focus this TAF cycle as it serves as focus for isolated convection
this afternoon and produces a wind shift at DFW early this
evening. FROPA at DFW and surrounding airports is still on track
for around 04/00Z, and will fine tune the timing as the boundary
draws near. Coverage of thunderstorms will be low enough to keep
out of TAFs at this time, though VCSH still looks good for late
afternoon in the Metroplex (late evening for KACT). A second VCSH
group in the extended DFW TAF has been added for Friday morning;
this based on multiple hi-res models keying in on moisture from
an inverted trough over south Texas surging northwest across the
region. Will also need to watch for post-frontal stratus which may
create occasional MVFR during the Friday AM hours.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 324 AM CDT Thu Oct 3 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

Morning satellite imagery reveals an upper low moving east across
the Northern Plains with a dominant ridge over the Deep South. At
the surface, a cold front is currently creeping south along the
I-40 corridor of Oklahoma, and should continue to advance
southward into North Texas later today.

The western flank of the upper ridge may initially act to
suppress any convection which attempts to develop along the front.
However, it appears that a weakness in this portion of the ridge
will develop this afternoon and evening, likely caused by an
easterly wave which will push inland over South Texas and Mexico
over the next 24 hours. The end result should be scattered showers
and a few storms late this afternoon through tonight. Due to the
subtleness of both the front and the weakness aloft, POPs will
remain on the conservative side and be limited to the chance or
slight chance range. Marginal instability and the complete absence
of deep layer shear should keep any storms well below severe
thresholds.

A far as temperatures are concerned, most locations should climb
into the lower and middle 90s again today; the exception being
the Red River counties where the front will have moved through
prior to peak heating. The good news is that the front should
reach the I-20 corridor before stalling late tonight or tomorrow,
which means that lows in the 60s are likely for areas roughly
north and west of the DFW Metroplex.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 324 AM CDT Thu Oct 3 2019/
/Friday through Wednesday/

Friday will offer a brief reprieve from the hot weather as the
first of a couple of cold fronts continues to ooze into the
region and the strong ridging to the east continues to break down.
We should start the day off cloudy with temperatures in the
mid/upper 60s across the north and lower 70s elsewhere with the
actual front somewhere just south of the Metroplex. We`ll be
within a region of weak ascent associated with a weak upper trough
spreading into Texas from the western Gulf of Mexico. Given an
increase in deep layer moisture, we could see some ongoing showers
or perhaps a few thunderstorms during the early morning hours.
High temperatures on Friday are a little bit of a challenge as the
aggressive 3km NAM keeps highs in the mid 70s to lower 80s across
the northern half of the region. While this seems plausible, it
appears very slow to re-establish southerly flow in response to a
strong trough digging through the western U.S. The coarser global
models are faster with a retreating front and warmer which makes
sense in this situation. So for Friday, we`ll keep high temps in
the upper 80s and lower 90s across most of the area. The only
exception will be along the Red River where highs may remain in
the low/mid 80s.

Saturday should be another warm day as the aforementioned trough
swings through the Plains and southerly flow returns. Highs will
likely top out in the low/mid 90s areawide with most of the
precipitation staying well off to the north of our area. This
trough will drive a stronger front southward though and it should
be moving through Oklahoma by Saturday evening. This front will
likely creep across the border and slowly spread south through the
day Sunday. Sunday should feature cooler temperatures across the
northern half of the area with our southern counties remaining hot
with highs in the lower 90s.

A reinforcing shot of significantly cooler and drier air will
arrive Sunday evening as an upstream trailing shortwave dives
through the Central Plains. This system will send a stronger surge
of air southward and will really be the first significant front of
the season. While the main forcing for ascent from the shortwave
will primarily be north of our area, strong ascent over the
frontal surface and ample low level moisture should result in at
least some scattered showers and perhaps a few thunderstorms
Sunday evening and night. We`ll have our highest PoPs during this
time. A marked decrease in moisture will bring a rapid end to any
precipitation early Monday with highs on Monday expected to top
out in the upper 70s, which would actually be slightly below
normal for this time of year.

The pleasant weather will continue through the middle part of the
week with little or no additional rain chances.
