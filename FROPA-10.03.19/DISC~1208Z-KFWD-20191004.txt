.AVIATION...
/12z TAFs/

Some mid-level echoes can be seen just east of DFW on area radar
imagery as of 1130z. These returns are associated with weak
ascent occurring near a mid-level disturbance on the southern
periphery of the upper ridge. At this point, it`s unlikely that
any precipitation is reaching the ground as it falls into a dry
sub cloud layer, but evaporation may act to increase turbulence as
this activity continues drifting westward into the D10 airspace.
Have not included VCSH in the TAFs, although this may need to be
added in subsequent AMDs.

Otherwise, the main feature of note is a stalled frontal zone
roughly near the I-20 corridor, with the associated surface
high resulting in light northerly/northeasterly winds at all
airports. This will remain the case throughout the day, before
winds begin slowly returning to the east or southeast later this
evening and overnight. As the frontal inversion deepens slightly
this morning, some MVFR cigs could develop after daybreak around
the DFW area, although the most widespread cigs will remain well
northwest of the TAF sites. Meanwhile, additional ascent from
low-level convergence in the vicinity of this front should
support scattered showers and thunderstorms this afternoon, and
will upgrade the previous VCSH to VCTS at all airports during a
brief window late this afternoon. Coverage is expected to be low,
and the potential for direct impacts from convection at any
particular airport is slim. Any activity would dissipate with loss
of heating.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 307 AM CDT Fri Oct 4 2019/
/Through Tonight/

As of 2am, a weak surface front was draped through the
northwestern portions of the CWA, roughly from Abilene to Paris.
The airmass behind this front is slightly cooler and drier, with
temperatures and dewpoints each 5-10 degrees lower than areas to
the south. However, the depth of the the post-frontal airmass is
quite shallow, and southeasterly flow still prevails from about
925mb upwards. The resultant low-level warm advection and
convergence coupled with weak dynamic ascent from an easterly wave
aloft is supporting showers and a couple thunderstorms south of
I-20 at the current time, which may continue through the remainder
of the morning.

The frontal zone will become increasingly diffuse by this
afternoon, and will go unnoticed for many locations today.
Temperatures will be a few degrees cooler than yesterday for much
of the area, but this will mainly be due to the increase in cloud
cover rather than cooler post-frontal air. The exception will be
across our far northern and western zones where highs may only
reach the low 80s. Due to the continued presence of the easterly
wave aloft and broad low-level convergence, convection will be
possible just about anywhere in the CWA as the boundary layer
becomes uncapped via diabatic heating this afternoon. Convective
coverage should be rather limited and sporadic without a well-
defined surface boundary, and PoPs of 20-30% will suffice.
Coverage may be greatest east of I-35 where the highest moisture
content has pooled, with PWs approaching 2 inches. Weak shear
should limit storm organization and severity, so token mentions of
gusty wind and lightning hazards will be advertised. Convection
should reach a maximum in the late afternoon or evening before a
downward trend at sunset.

Later this evening, surface winds will already begin returning to
the east and southeast across the entire forecast area as the
front washes out while retreating northward. This will lead to
another abnormally warm and muggy night with lows in the upper 60s
and low 70s.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 307 AM CDT Fri Oct 4 2019/
/Saturday through Next Week/

A negative-tilt shortwave trough on the front side of a larger
scale upper trough will cross the Northern Plains on Saturday. An
attendant surface cyclone will lift northeast across Minnesota,
with a cold front trailing from the surface low southward then
southwestward into Oklahoma. The front will likely stall north of
the Red River, but the current forecast will continue with slight
chance POPs along our northern row of counties Saturday afternoon
and evening where isolated convection immediately south of the
front cannot be ruled out.

As the initial disturbance heads for the Great Lakes, a second
shortwave on the rear flank of the main trough will dive southeast
through the Southern Plains on Sunday, sending the front surging
southward through all of North and Central Texas. This will be the
first decent front of the season, which at this time looks to
cross the Red River by Sunday afternoon and clear the southern-
most counties shortly after midnight Sunday night. The front
should be accompanied by a broken line of convection, but with the
trailing shortwave being positively tilted and forcing for ascent
being minimal, severe storms are unlikely.

The bigger story will be the much-anticipated arrival of seasonable
weather as temperatures drop to slightly below normal for Monday
and Tuesday. Locations across the northwest may drop into the 50s
Sunday night, but the coolest air should occur Monday night with
widespread 50s expected for low temperatures.

A warm-up will then ensue mid week as return flow develops ahead
of a deepening low pressure system near the Rockies. Recent
guidance indicates a fairly potent upper level system as the low
swings eastward across the Plains during the second half of the
week. The result in this case would be another strong cold front
late Thursday or Friday, which may bring an even cooler airmass
to the region for day 7 and beyond. Much stronger jet dynamics as
currently advertised would also mean a better chance of strong
convection, though it is too soon to dig deeply into any
specifics. Will keep POPs on the conservative side for now and
monitor over the weekend.
